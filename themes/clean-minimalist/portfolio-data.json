      "I'm Tony Stark - genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist. After being held captive in Afghanistan, I built the first Iron Man suit in a cave with a box of scraps. That experience changed everything - I went from weapons manufacturer to Earth's greatest defender. I've pioneered arc reactor technology, created advanced AI systems like J.A.R.V.I.S. and F.R.I.D.A.Y., and led the Avengers against threats ranging from rogue robots to intergalactic warlords.",
      "Beyond building suits, I focus on clean energy innovation, nanotechnology advancement, and protecting the world from threats both terrestrial and cosmic. By combining my engineering genius, unlimited resources, and an unwavering commitment to humanity's future, I deliver solutions that others consider impossible. I am Iron Man."
